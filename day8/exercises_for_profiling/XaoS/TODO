TODO ITEMS
----------

Visit the issue tracker at http://code.google.com/p/gnuxaos/issues/list
for a list of outstanding issues.

In particular, we would welcome volunteers to help us finish the 
following projects that we are currently focusing on:


GTK+ User Interface (Beta)
==========================

The GTK+ user interface is approaching beta quality.  We welcome beta 
testers to try out this version and let us know what issues you encounter. 
Please share your feedback with us on the developer's discussion group at:
http://groups.google.com/group/xaos-devel.

We ask that beta testers be advanced users who are comfortable compiling
software from source and submitting useful bug reports including backtraces.
If you are not comfortable with this, then please wait for the final version
to be released.  We would also really appreciate it if any experienced GTK+ 
developers can review our code and make suggestions for improvement. 

Since the GTK+ UI is still not ready for everyday use, it will not be 
compiled by default. You must explicitly enable it using the following
configure switch:

	--with-gtk-driver=yes

In addition, we recommend you disable all other drivers when using the GTK
driver using the following configure switches:

	--with-x11-driver=no


New Documentation Format (Beta)
===============================

We are in the process of migrating the XaoS help system to Sphinx and
reStructuredText.  Our  user manual was previously in a crippled subset 
of HTML that we dubbed XSHL, which was missing many features necessary 
for maintaining modern, attractive documentation.  

Sphinx was developed by the Python project for their documentation, and 
it is very similar to a Wiki in the way you mark  up the text.  It can 
output the results as HTML, PDF, and Windows Help.  It supports all the
important things that are missing from the current help format, such as
tables, images, and internet hyperlinks.  It can even convert LaTeX math 
markup into image files that get included in the HTML output.

The documentation still needs a lot of work before it is ready, and we 
have to make some modifications to Sphinx itself in order to integrate 
the documentation it produces with XaoS's help system.  However, it is 
far enough along that we would welcome volunteers who are familar with 
reStructuredText to submit improvements to the documentation.

The new documentation is located in the help/rest directory, and it can
be converted into HTML or PDF using the included Makefile.  In order to
generate the output, you will need to install Sphinx.  Visit the Sphinx
homepage at http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ for installation instructions and
more information on the new documentation format.

If you would like to help with the documentation, please contact us on 
the discussion group at: http://groups.google.com/group/xaos-devel.
We will be happy to help you get started.
