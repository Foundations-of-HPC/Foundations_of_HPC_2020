Reset to defaults
=================

**Syntax**:(initstate)

This function resets most of XaoS's values to their defaults. It is useful when
you get lost and want to start from the beginning. It should also be used as
the first command of every animation file, to ensure that the file is always
played with the same settings in effect.

**Available as**: menu item, command line option, command
