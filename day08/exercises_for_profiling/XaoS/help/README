This directory contains several files for documentation of XaoS.

The main file is xaos.hlp. From this will all scripts generate
documentation files.

To create HTML documentation (many .html files), please run
"make html".

To create TeX documentation (.dvi files) or .info files, go to ../doc
and type "make".

To create .rtf documentation, type "make rtf" or run "rtfconv.bat" (on
Windows/CygWin development system). You will need xaoswin.rtf in order
to generate xaoswin.hlp for your running Windows executable.

To create xaoswin.hlp, you need the HCW package. Note that you also need
xaoswin.Hpj and xaoswin.rtf (xaoswin.rtf must be generated with
"make rtf" or using the "rtfconv.bat" utility).

Finally, "make" will generate both .html and .rtf documentation.
