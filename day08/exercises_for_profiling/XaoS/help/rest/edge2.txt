Edge detection2
===============

This filter is a standard edge detection algorithm; solid areas are filled in
black. Some fractals look very interesting with this filter (and some areas of
some fractals just look like noise). This version of the filter produces
relatively tight lines, so is useful at lower resolutions. The filter
:ref:`edge detection <edge>` makes thinner lines, for the high resolution
modes.

**Available as**: menu item, command line option
