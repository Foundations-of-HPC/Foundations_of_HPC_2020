Newton
======

This is Newton's approximation method for finding the roots of a polynomial. It
uses the polynomial x^3=1 and counts the number of iterations needed to reach
the approximate value of the root. See the :tutor:`tutorial chapter <newton.xaf>`.

This fractal doesn't have Julia sets, but XaoS is able to generate Julia-like
sets which are also very interesting (they are sometimes called "Nova
formulae").

**Available as**: menu item, command line option
