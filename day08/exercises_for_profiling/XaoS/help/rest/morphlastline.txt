Morph last line
---------------

**Syntax**:(morphlastline keyword complex complex)

This function has the same functionality as :ref:`morphline <morphline>`, but
it doesn't increase the line key, and touches the line with the previous key.
This is useful when you want to move a just-drawn line--you don't need to set
:ref:`linekey <linekey>` back.

**Available as**: command
