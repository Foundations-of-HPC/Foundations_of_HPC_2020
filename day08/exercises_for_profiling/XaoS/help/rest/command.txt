Command
=======

You can invoke all XaoS functions using a simple command language reminiscent
of Scheme. This option lets you run a single command. If you want to run more
than one, you might want to use an :ref:`XaoS animation file <format>` instead;
they are written in the same language.

**Available as**: menu item
