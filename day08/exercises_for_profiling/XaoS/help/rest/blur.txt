Motion blur
===========

Motion blur mixes the current frame with previous ones to produce a motion-blur
effect. It might be rather slow in 16bpp truecolor modes. The best results can
probably be seen in 8bpp modes, so you might want to enable the :ref:`palette
filter <palettef>` first.

**Available as**: menu item, command line option
