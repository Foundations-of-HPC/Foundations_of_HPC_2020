Animate view
============

**Syntax**:(animateview float float float float)

This function is almost identical to function :ref:`view <uiview>`. It expects
that the view will be changed only slightly, so recalculation is done with
ANIMATE priority. This means that dynamic resolution is used by default.

Viewport is selected by the center and two radiuses (real and imaginary). See
:ref:`view <uiview>` for more information.

**Available as**: command
